        <h3>What is babblevoice?</h3>
        <p>Babblevoice is a smart cloud-hosted telephony system built specifically for GP surgeries. It is simple to use, yet meets the complex needs of todayâ€™s GP practices, CCGs and PCNs. We excel in areas such as cost effectiveness, line capacity, flexibility, remote-working, and real-time reporting. 

            All with no minimum contract terms or exit fees. 
            
            Our mission is to deliver a phone system that supports surgeries in delivering care to patients, with functionality that includes:
            - intelligent call routing and queuing enabling telephone triage
            - integration with EMIS and SystmOne allowing secure automated access to patient records
            - automated patient-led booking and managing of appointments
            - call recording for monitoring and training
            - real-time reporting

        <h3>What is my role?</h3>
            <p>I am a Software Developer in a small 4 person team. My job is primarily to develop, test and maintain our new core telephony system, which includes all the features mentioned above as well as
