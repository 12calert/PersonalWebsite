        <h3>What is Babblevoice?</h3>
        <p>Babblevoice is a smart cloud-hosted telephony system built specifically for GP surgeries. It is simple to use, yet meets the complex needs of todayâ€™s GP practices, CCGs and PCNs. We excel in areas such as cost effectiveness, line capacity, flexibility, remote-working, and real-time reporting. 

            <p>All with no minimum contract terms or exit fees.</p>
            
            <p>Our mission is to deliver a phone system that supports surgeries in delivering care to patients, with functionality that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>intelligent call routing and queuing enabling telephone triage</li>
                <li>integration with EMIS and SystmOne allowing secure automated access to patient records</li>
                <li>automated patient-led booking and managing of appointments</li>
                <li>call recording for monitoring and training</li>
                <li>real-time reporting</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>What is my role?</h3>
            <p>I am a Software Developer in a small 4 person team. My job is primarily to develop, test and maintain our new core telephony system, which includes all the features mentioned above.</p>
            <p>Some interesting projects I worked on (that are available to the general public):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>projectrtp - An RTP node addon which offers functionality to process RTP data streams and mix it. All performance tasks are implemented in C++ and use boost::asio for IO completion ports for high concurrency.
                    It is an open source project under an MIT license available <a href="https://github.com/babblevoice/projectrtp">here.</a>
                </li>
                <li>Website functionalities - Developed a whole range tools used by Practice Managers and doctores, such as a widely praised by the GP surgeries Vibes suite, which is a tool for phone call data visualisation.</li>
            </ul>
